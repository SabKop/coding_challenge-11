# coding_challenge-11

What is the Challenge?
Here is the story: You just started a freelancing software company: Creative/Inc (original name, I know). You just hired a designer and also got your first client. After meeting with the client, you now have an idea of what they want to build and the designer has sent you some design files in order for you to build the rest of the page. Your challenge is to build the page up using the skills you have learned in the course to get the product finished to the client by the end of the month. Good luck and have fun!


The Rules Are:
1. Use the assets in this github repository to finish the client's website so you can make them happy. These are all the files that the designer and the client sent you to finish the website. You will notice that they used HSL color format (https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp).

2. You have until November 30th at 11:59pm EST to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the #coding-challenge Discord channel with the following message: "-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY" The bot will listen for the command and will submit the link you provided in the command. Please check that the bot responded with "Thanks for submitting your coding challenge entry!" and then double check the details it provides. We will compile all submissions here at the end of the month.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.
